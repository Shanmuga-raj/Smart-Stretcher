# Smart Stretcher
Final Year Project:

###### ```OBJECTIVE:```
The Smart Stretcher is to sense the body condition of an unconscious person who is in medical need as their physical parameters are updated to the server regularly using IoT (Internet of Things).
***

###### ```ABSTRACT:```
The Smart Stretcher is nothing but a Stretcher which has an automated Arduino and Sensors infused in it. So that, when a person is placed is our Smart Stretcher is starts to sense the body conditions of that person and the readings will be saved to our server from the time since he has been pickedup until he reaches hospital and the readings will be saved regularly for a certain time period. In this way, Doctors can able to view the body condition of that person and take action as soon as possible.

The Device performs the following:

(i)  Detect the person body conditions such as Heartbeat, Respiratory, Temperature, Weight. <br />
(ii) Display the reading to the LCD at the same time uploading it to the server for a certain time period regularly.
